## Detailed Analysis

### S2P1: Load and validate datasets with modality-specific preprocessing
**Rating:** 2 (Partial Support)

**Evidence:**
- **Multi-Modal Data Support**: The framework handles multiple modalities through separate benchmark implementations:
  - Text: `language/bert/dataset.py`, `language/llama2-70b/dataset.py`, `language/deepseek-r1/utils/data_utils.py`
  - Image: `vision/classification_and_detection/python/dataset.py`, `text_to_image/dataset.py`
  - Audio: `speech2text/QSL.py` (Whisper benchmark with LibriSpeech)
  - Medical Imaging: `vision/medical_imaging/3d-unet-kits19/preprocess.py`
  - 3D Point Cloud: `automotive/3d-object-detection/dataset.py` (Waymo)

- **Preprocessing Pipelines**:
  - Vision: OpenCV-based preprocessing with resizing, normalization (`vision/classification_and_detection/python/dataset.py`)
  - Medical Imaging: Comprehensive preprocessing with resampling, normalization, and shape standardization (`vision/medical_imaging/3d-unet-kits19/preprocess.py`)
  - Audio: Librosa-based loading at 16kHz sample rate (`speech2text/QSL.py`)
  - Text: Basic tokenization support (`language/deepseek-r1/utils/tokenization.py`)

- **Validation Capabilities**:
  - Basic dataset validation exists: `language/deepseek-r1/utils/data_utils.py` - `validate_dataset()`, `validate_dataset_extended()`
  - Schema validation: Checks for required columns in DataFrames
  - File existence checks in data loading utilities
  - Limited format and quality validation

**Example Configuration:**
```python
# From vision/medical_imaging/3d-unet-kits19/preprocess.py
python3 preprocess.py --raw_data_dir $(RAW_DATA_DIR) \
    --results_dir $(PREPROCESSED_DATA_DIR) --mode preprocess

# From vision/classification_and_detection/python/dataset.py
class Dataset:
    def preprocess(self, use_cache=True):
        # Modality-specific preprocessing
```

**Limitations:**
- No unified preprocessing framework across modalities
- Each benchmark implements its own data loading and preprocessing
- Limited schema validation (basic column checks only)
- No comprehensive data quality checks (e.g., missing values, outliers, distribution analysis)
- No built-in data format converters
- Preprocessing is benchmark-specific, not reusable across tasks

---

### S2P2: Build retrieval infrastructure
**Rating:** 0 (No Support)

**Evidence:**
- No dedicated retrieval infrastructure found in the codebase
- No vector indexing capabilities (FAISS, ColBERT, BM25)
- No document encoding or embedding generation utilities
- Search for "faiss", "colbert", "bm25", "retrieval" yielded only embedding layers in neural network models (DLRM)
- DLRM benchmark uses embeddings but for recommendation, not retrieval

**Example Configuration:**
None - Feature not implemented

**Limitations:**
- Framework does not support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows
- No utilities for building vector indices
- No corpus preprocessing for retrieval tasks
- No support for different retrieval methods
- Users must implement all retrieval infrastructure outside the framework

---

### S2P3: Prepare vector search benchmarks
**Rating:** 0 (No Support)

**Evidence:**
- No utilities for loading pre-computed embeddings
- No ground truth nearest neighbor computation
- No vector normalization utilities for benchmarking
- No distance metric computation tools
- Search for "embedding", "vector", "knn", "nearest neighbor" only found model-specific embedding layers

**Example Configuration:**
None - Feature not implemented

**Limitations:**
- Cannot prepare vector search benchmarks within the framework
- No support for BEIR or other vector search evaluation datasets
- No tools for computing recall@k metrics
- Users must implement all vector search preparation externally

---

### S2P4: Validate model artifacts
**Rating:** 1 (Basic Support)

**Evidence:**
- **Checksum Verification**: Limited to medical imaging benchmark
  - `vision/medical_imaging/3d-unet-kits19/preprocess.py` implements MD5 hash verification
  - Functions: `generate_hash_from_volume()`, `generate_hash_from_dataset()`, `verify_dataset()`
  - Stores checksums in JSON files: `CHECKSUM_INFER_FILE`, `CHECKSUM_CALIB_FILE`

- **Model Download Verification**: Basic verification in some benchmarks
  - `language/llama2-70b/main.py`: `verify_model_name()` function
  - `retired_benchmarks/speech_recognition/rnnt/pytorch/utils/download_utils.py`: `md5_checksum()` function

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Verify preprocessed data integrity
python3 preprocess.py --raw_data_dir $(RAW_DATA_DIR) \
    --results_dir $(PREPROCESSED_DATA_DIR) --mode verify

# Generate checksums
python3 preprocess.py --raw_data_dir $(RAW_DATA_DIR) \
    --results_dir $(PREPROCESSED_DATA_DIR) --mode gen-hash
```

```python
# From vision/medical_imaging/3d-unet-kits19/preprocess.py
def verify_dataset(args):
    """Verifies preprocessed data's integrity by comparing MD5 hashes"""
    with open(CHECKSUM_FILE) as f:
        source = json.load(f)
    # Compare computed hashes with stored reference
```

**Limitations:**
- Checksum verification only implemented for medical imaging preprocessing, not for model files
- No centralized model validation framework
- No version management system for models
- No configuration validation utilities
- No dependency checking
- No integrity checks for model weights across benchmarks
- Implementation is benchmark-specific, not reusable

---

### S2P5: Generate evaluation scenarios
**Rating:** 0 (No Support)

**Evidence:**
- No scenario generation tools found
- LoadGen defines test scenarios (SingleStream, MultiStream, Server, Offline) but doesn't generate them
- From `loadgen/test_settings.h` and `text_to_image/main.py`:
  ```python
  SCENARIO_MAP = {
      "SingleStream": lg.TestScenario.SingleStream,
      "MultiStream": lg.TestScenario.MultiStream,
      "Server": lg.TestScenario.Server,
      "Offline": lg.TestScenario.Offline,
  }
  ```
- These are execution modes, not generated test cases

**Example Configuration:**
None - Feature not implemented

**Limitations:**
- No tools for creating evaluation templates
- No adversarial input generation
- No multi-turn dialogue scenario builders
- No test case generators
- Users must manually create all evaluation scenarios
- Cannot generate synthetic test cases for edge cases
- No support for domain-specific scenario generation

---

### S2P6: Create deterministic data splits
**Rating:** 0 (No Support)

**Evidence:**
- No data splitting utilities found in the framework
- Search for "train_test_split", "split", stratification yielded only one result in retired benchmarks
- Only `automotive/3d-object-detection/waymo.py` has basic splitting logic
- Benchmarks use pre-defined validation/test sets from external sources:
  - SQuAD v1.1 validation set (BERT)
  - ImageNet validation set (ResNet)
  - OpenImages evaluation set (RetinaNet)
  - KiTS19 evaluation set defined in JSON: `vision/medical_imaging/3d-unet-kits19/meta/inference_cases.json`

**Example Configuration:**
None - Framework relies on external pre-split datasets

**Limitations:**
- No reproducible splitting functions
- No seed management for deterministic splits
- No sample ID assignment system
- No stratified sampling support
- No support for custom splitting strategies (e.g., time-based, group-based)
- Cannot create train/val/test splits within the framework
- Relies entirely on pre-split datasets from external sources

## Framework Architecture Notes

**MLPerf Inference Framework Structure:**
1. **LoadGen** (`loadgen/`): Core library that generates queries and measures performance
   - Implements test scenarios and traffic patterns
   - NOT aware of models, datasets, or preprocessing
   - Uses dependency injection pattern with SUT (System Under Test) and QSL (Query Sample Library)

2. **Benchmark-Specific Implementations** (`language/`, `vision/`, `text_to_image/`, etc.):
   - Each benchmark implements its own dataset loading and preprocessing
   - Custom SUT and QSL implementations per benchmark
   - No shared data preparation infrastructure

3. **Data Flow**:
   ```
   Dataset Files → Benchmark-specific Loader → QSL → LoadGen → SUT → Post-processing → Results
   ```

**Design Philosophy:**
- Framework is **inference-focused**, not training or data preparation focused
- Emphasizes performance measurement over data pipeline features
- Each benchmark is self-contained with minimal shared utilities
- Users are expected to prepare data externally before using the framework

**Key Insight:**
MLPerf Inference is primarily a **benchmarking harness** for measuring inference performance, not a comprehensive evaluation framework with data preparation capabilities. It assumes data is already prepared and focuses on standardized performance measurement across different hardware and software implementations.

## Overall Assessment

**Total Score: 3/18 (17%)**

The MLPerf Inference framework provides **minimal support for Step 2 (PREPARE) processes**. It focuses on inference performance measurement rather than data preparation:

**Strengths:**
- Multiple modality support (text, image, audio, medical imaging, 3D)
- Basic preprocessing pipelines for each modality
- Some data validation in newer benchmarks (deepseek-r1)
- Limited checksum verification for data integrity

**Weaknesses:**
- No retrieval infrastructure (RAG, vector search)
- No scenario generation tools
- No data splitting utilities
- Limited model artifact validation
- Benchmark-specific implementations without shared utilities
- Assumes external data preparation

**Recommendation:**
Organizations needing comprehensive data preparation and evaluation capabilities should supplement MLPerf Inference with additional tools for:
- Vector indexing and retrieval (e.g., FAISS, Elasticsearch)
- Scenario generation and synthetic data creation
- Data splitting and versioning (e.g., DVC, MLflow)
- Model validation and artifact management (e.g., MLflow Model Registry)
