## Detailed Analysis

### S5P1: Compute aggregate statistics
**Rating:** 1 (Basic Support)

**Evidence:**
- **Basic mean/average computation** exists across evaluation scripts:
  - `language/deepseek-r1/eval_accuracy.py`: Computes mean accuracy and mean token length
    ```python
    accuracy = df_evaluated['prompt_accuracy'].mean()
    mean_output_len = float(df_evaluated['tok_model_output_len'].mean())
    ```
  - `language/llama2-70b/consolidate_results.py`: Aggregates ROUGE scores using numpy mean
    ```python
    agg = {k: round(np.mean(v) * 100, 4) for k, v in rouge_scores.items()}
    print("Avg output seqlen:", np.mean(output_lens))
    ```
  - `language/gpt-j/evaluation.py`: Similar mean-based aggregation
    ```python
    result = {k: f"{round(np.mean(v) * 100, 4)}" for k, v in result.items()}
    ```

- **No built-in support for:**
  - Median, percentiles, or variance calculation
  - Weighted aggregation functions
  - Outlier detection or robust statistics
  - Missing data handling utilities
  - Statistical confidence intervals

- **Implementation approach:** Each benchmark implements its own basic statistics manually using numpy/pandas

**Limitations:**
- No centralized aggregation framework or API
- Each benchmark reimplements basic statistics
- No advanced statistical functions (median, percentiles, variance, std dev)
- No utilities for handling missing data or outliers
- No support for weighted aggregation or custom aggregation functions
- Aggregation logic is hardcoded in individual evaluation scripts

### S5P2: Perform stratified analysis
**Rating:** 1 (Basic Support)

**Evidence:**
- **Minimal dataset-level grouping** in evaluation scripts:
  - `language/deepseek-r1/eval_accuracy.py`: Groups results by dataset name
    ```python
    for dataset_name, group_indices in tqdm(df_output.groupby('dataset').groups.items(),
                                            desc="Processing datasets"):
        evaluator = get_evaluator(dataset_name)
        # Process each dataset separately
    ```
  - This allows separate accuracy calculation per dataset (gpqa, mmlu_pro, math500, aime, livecodebench)

- **Submission system tracking** via `submission_checker.py`:
  - Tracks results by organization, division, system type
  - Groups by model, scenario, category (datacenter/edge)
  - No automated stratification analysis - just organizational structure

- **No support for:**
  - Stratification by metadata attributes (demographics, domains, difficulty levels)
  - Multi-dimensional stratification or cross-tabulation
  - Fairness metrics or bias analysis tools
  - Automated slicing utilities beyond simple dataset grouping
  - Statistical comparison across strata

**Limitations:**
- Stratification is limited to basic dataset grouping
- No built-in fairness or bias analysis capabilities
- No support for analyzing performance across demographic groups
- No tools for multi-dimensional slicing (e.g., by domain AND difficulty)
- No utilities for statistical significance testing across strata
- Results must be manually analyzed per dataset/group

### S5P3: Generate diagnostic visualizations
**Rating:** 0 (No Support)

**Evidence:**
- **No visualization libraries** imported in core evaluation scripts:
  - Searched for matplotlib, pyplot, seaborn, plotly - found only in:
    - `retired_benchmarks/translation/gnmt/tensorflow/nmt/nmt.py` (retired benchmark)
    - `vision/classification_and_detection/python/pycoco.py` (COCO API only, not for analysis)

- **ROC curve calculation exists** but only in retired DLRM benchmark:
  - `retired_benchmarks/recommendation/dlrm/tf/roc_metrics/roc_metrics.cc`:
    ```cpp
    float RocMetrics::ComputeRocAuc() {
      // Computes ROC AUC but no visualization
      // Generates TPR and FPR vectors
      double auc = Trapz(tpr, fpr);
      return static_cast<float>(auc);
    }
    ```
  - Only computes AUC value, does not generate visual plots
  - Not available in current active benchmarks

- **No implementations for:**
  - Confusion matrices
  - ROC curves (visual plots)
  - Precision-Recall curves
  - Calibration plots
  - Error distribution visualizations
  - Interactive exploration tools

  - No detailed error categorization or analysis

- **Performance metrics are separate:**
  - Performance runs track latency/throughput via LoadGen
  - Accuracy runs compute correctness metrics
  - No built-in tools to correlate or analyze tradeoffs between them

**Limitations:**
- No performance-quality tradeoff analysis capabilities
- No tools for plotting latency vs accuracy curves
- No systematic failure pattern detection
- No error clustering or categorization
- No root cause analysis utilities
- No bias detection in model errors
- Performance and accuracy are analyzed separately without integrated tradeoff analysis
- Users must manually correlate performance and accuracy results

### S5P5: Rank and compare models against baselines
**Rating:** 2 (Partial Support)

**Evidence:**
- **Baseline accuracy comparison** via `submission_checker.py`:
  - Defines baseline accuracy thresholds for each model:
    ```python
    ACCURACY_TARGETS = {
        "resnet": ("acc", 76.46 * 0.99),
        "bert-99": ("f1", 90.874 * 0.99),
        "llama2-70b-99": ("ROUGEL", 28.6162 * 0.99, "TOKENS_PER_SAMPLE", 294.45 * 0.9),
        "deepseek-r1": ("exact_match", 0.99 * 81.3582, "TOKENS_PER_SAMPLE", 0.9 * 3886.2274),
        # ... more models
    }
    ```
  - Validates submissions against these baseline thresholds
  - Calculates relative difference from baseline

- **Compliance testing baseline comparison:**
  - `compliance/nvidia/TEST01/create_accuracy_baseline.sh`: Creates baseline for comparison
  - Compares compliance run accuracy against baseline accuracy
  - Reports pass/fail based on threshold

- **Leaderboard generation** via `generate_final_report.py`:
  - Creates Excel spreadsheet with results from all submissions
  - Organizes by model, scenario, category (datacenter/edge)
  - Includes system details, performance metrics, accuracy
  - Generates hyperlinks to submission details and code
  - Example columns: Submitter, System, Processors, Accelerators, Results
  - No automated ranking or sorting by performance

- **Limited statistical testing:**
  - No statistical significance testing for model comparisons

## Framework Architecture Assessment

**Overall Framework Design:**
MLPerf Inference is designed as a **benchmarking and submission framework**, not an analysis framework. Its primary focus is on:
1. Running inference workloads via LoadGen
2. Computing accuracy metrics per benchmark
3. Validating submissions against rules
4. Organizing results for reporting

**Analysis Gap:**
The framework intentionally delegates Step 5 (ANALYZE) capabilities to external tools. Users are expected to:
- Export results to pandas DataFrames (pickle files)
- Use external tools (Jupyter notebooks, R, custom scripts) for analysis
- Manually create visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn/etc.
- Perform statistical analysis using scipy/statsmodels/etc.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Evaluation â‰  Analysis:** The framework evaluates correctness but doesn't analyze patterns
2. **Per-benchmark approach:** Each benchmark has custom evaluation logic
3. **No centralized analytics:** No shared analysis utilities or APIs
4. **Minimal aggregation:** Only basic mean calculations
5. **No visualization:** Zero built-in plotting capabilities
6. **Limited comparison:** Baseline thresholding only, no statistical testing

---

## Recommendations for Users

Given the limited Step 5 support, users should:

1. **Export results:** Use the pickle/JSON outputs from evaluation scripts
2. **External analysis:** Leverage pandas, numpy, scipy for statistics
3. **Custom visualization:** Create plots using matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly
4. **Statistical testing:** Use scipy.stats or statsmodels for significance testing
5. **Custom stratification:** Implement domain-specific slicing in post-processing
6. **Build on framework:** The framework provides a good foundation for running benchmarks; analysis tooling can be built on top

## Score Summary

**Total Score: 4 / 15 points**

- **S5P1 (Aggregate Statistics):** 1/3 - Basic mean calculations only
- **S5P2 (Stratified Analysis):** 1/3 - Minimal dataset grouping
- **S5P3 (Diagnostic Visualizations):** 0/3 - No visualization support
- **S5P4 (Tradeoff & Failure Analysis):** 0/3 - No analysis tools
- **S5P5 (Ranking & Comparison):** 2/3 - Basic baseline comparison and leaderboard generation

**Overall Assessment:** MLPerf Inference provides **minimal Step 5 ANALYZE support**. It is fundamentally a benchmarking and submission framework, not an analysis framework. Users must rely on external tools and custom code for comprehensive analysis tasks.
